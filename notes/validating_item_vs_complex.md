# complex-object characteristics
- model = Generic 
    - although, could conceive of an item with model = Generic, or at least the system would allow it???
- format = https://w3id.org/spar/mediatype/application/xml
    - this seems like one to differentiate on, don't imagine any scenario where any row in metadata spreadsheet that wasn't a complex object would have format = XML...
    - TO CONFIRM will it always be in spreadsheet??
- resource_type = http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection
    - this also, use this
    - as above, will it always be in the spreadsheet??
