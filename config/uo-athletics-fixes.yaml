# No need to specify the string when using enforce - it will read the correct value from uo-athletics.yaml, since it 
# expects only one specific, unchanging value
fixes:
  # fix institution having extra space at the end
  - type: strip
    column: institution
  
  # fix license being wrong type (usually nc instead of nc-nd)
  - type: enforce_string
    column: license
  
  # fix location using http over https
  - type: regex_replace
    column: location
    # select the start of the geonames url
    pattern: '^http://'
    # replace http with https, keeping the rest of the url intact
    replacement: 'https://'

    # fix file column missing file extension (append .tif to the end of the ID, which is what's almost always there instead)
  - type: regex_replace
    column: file
    pattern: '^(.*?)(?<!\.tif)$'
    replacement: '\1.tif'
